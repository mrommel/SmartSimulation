            summary: "The average wage level in your country. Wages are generally set by supply and demand, which roughly equates to the labor supply and the state of the economy (GDP). Immigration raises the labor supply, reducing wages, and high unemployment will also put downward pressure on wages. Labor laws, including minimum wages can push wages artificially higher, although this will have side-effects.",
